# NodeJs-Assignment
Create a rest api method in node.js which allows only authenticated users to upload the image
of maximum size of 500 KB.
For Authentication, try to use a secure authentication method.
You can use MySQL/MongoDB database with an users table in it and can put some user data
manually to check authentication.
Please make sure to code by yourself, because as part of evaluation we will be doing live
coding with you and you will be asked to make changes in the code in screen share.
